What is **nyabot**?  

It certainly wouldn't be a preposterous proposition if one were to claim that it might indeed be easier to describe what nyabot is *not*; This is merely an inevitable consequence of the magnitude of revolutionary technological solutions we're developing here at nyandev.

Nyabot is not food; It is not furniture, and it is not running shoes, unless we're to deliberately consider the effect of global marketplace disruption as an act of sprinting towards the future, faster than any competitor that exists at this point in time, has existed in the history of humanity, or is going to exist in the future.

Nyabot is a tool to efficiently enable fungible supply chains and proactively drive user-centric schemas of operational principle. It is a solution to collaboratively re-engineer cooperative leadership skills and dramatically disintermediate client-centered, effective "outside the box" thinking.

It is a technology to distinctively enable extensible use cases, monotonectally extend integrated infrastructures and dramatically myocardinate excellence in human-centric network infrastructure.

Nyabot is the future.
